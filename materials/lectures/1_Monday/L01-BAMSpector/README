This folder contains a simple 'shiny' app for visualizing aligned reads
in the context of known gene models. The R code is pretty compact, using
functions from Gviz and 'under the hood' the genomic ranges infrastructure
mentioned in the lecture

It requries several packages, installed with

  biocLite(c('RNAseqData.HNRNPC.bam.chr14', 'Homo.sapiens', 'shiny', 'Gviz'))

Then, start R and use `setwd()` to set to the working directory to the
directory containing the 'ui.R' and 'server.R' scripts. Run the app with

  shiny::runApp()
