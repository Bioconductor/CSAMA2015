## What is metagenomics

- There are microbes **everywhere**
- Let's sequence them!
- Typical applications:
  - Human health: microbiome of the gut, skin, lung, oral cavity, etc.
  - Environment: soil, lakes, oceans, ...

## Technologies

- DNA Sequencing (**Metagenomics**)
- RNA Sequencing (**Metatranscriptomics**)
- Mass-Spec (**Metaproteomics** and **Metabolomics**)
- ...

We will focus on sequencing-based approaches, i.e. DNA and RNA sequencing

## Estimating Bacterial Abundances
16s rRNA is a subunit of the ribosome, it carries a *fingerprint* for bacterial species.

- put primers in the conserved regions
- amplify the variable regions
- get bacterial abundance estimates :)

## Estimating Bacterial Abundances

Whole Metagenome Sequencing (WMGS) is the sequencign of all DNA found in a sample. Default Workflow:

## Slide with Interactive Plot

```{r, echo=FALSE}
inputPanel(
  selectInput("n_breaks", label = "Number of bins:",
              choices = c(10, 20, 35, 50), selected = 20),
  
  sliderInput("bw_adjust", label = "Bandwidth adjustment:",
              min = 0.2, max = 2, value = 1, step = 0.2)
)

renderPlot({
  hist(faithful$eruptions, probability = TRUE, breaks = as.numeric(input$n_breaks),
       xlab = "Duration (minutes)", main = "Geyser eruption duration")
  
  dens <- density(faithful$eruptions, adjust = input$bw_adjust)
  lines(dens, col = "blue")
})
```
