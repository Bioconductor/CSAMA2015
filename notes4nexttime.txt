Vince's clustering & classification lecture needs more time than 45 min. 90 min?
Wolfgang's testing & mult. testing lecture needs more time than 45 min. 60 min?

Someone suggested a 'biology' lecture: from DNA to phenotype (via chromatin, transcription, translation, proteins, cell types, ...) (a la Aleks)

Review file formats, e.g. gtf, and data types e.g. txdb

How to do a lab? I.e. what to do when you get stuck. Finding help on what the fuctions/arguments actually do. Exploring the workspace. Understand error messages, check for parentheses etc.
Provide .Rproj files for labs so people find files 
An "Advanced R" lab that is really intro.

Each lab should state the objectives, and summarise the learned steps.

Interactive session e.g. like what Vince prepared this time.

Need to arrive earlier up on Plose - e.g. 16.00 at top cable car for dinner at 19.00h


Suggestion: mix essential hard-core lectures (DESeq, stats, ...) with more relaxed/general interest topics such as metagenomics and proteomics to make some mornings lighter.


Computational statistics aspects (advances) for multi-omic assays
