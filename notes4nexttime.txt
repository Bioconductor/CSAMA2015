Vince's clustering & classification lecture needs more time than 45 min. 90 min?
Wolfgang's testing & mult. testing lecture needs more time than 45 min. 60 min?
Someone suggest a 'biology' lecture: from DNA to phenotype (via chromatin, transcription, translation, proteins, cell types, ...)

Need to arrive earlier up on Plose - e.g. 16.00 at top cable car for dinner at 19.00h
